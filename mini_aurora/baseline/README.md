# [BP-04] Offline static EAGLE-3 baseline

Tracks #10. Branch: `bp/04-static-baseline`.

- No public EAGLE-3 draft for 0.6B, so train one: dump target hidden states on the **chat-only** split (mirrors `OfflineEagle3Dataset`), train 1–2 epochs, freeze.
- This checkpoint is both the *static* baseline and the init for *with-draft* mode.
- **Done when:** τ̄ clearly > 0 on held-out chat data in BP-05's loop.
